/**
 * Preserves site navigation context across the CmsPage edit/create flow.
 *
 * When a user enters the page editor from a Site relation manager (Sites
 * → Pages → Edit), the receiving page captures `?from_site=<id>` at
 * mount() and threads it through the rest of the lifecycle as a Livewire
 * property. After save / delete the user is sent back to the originating
 * Site edit page instead of the global Pages index — preserving the
 * site-context the user was working in.
 *
 * The query param is read ONCE in mount(); afterward the captured
 * property is durable across Livewire `/livewire/update` round trips
 * (which don't carry the original query string). The trait stays inert
 * on single-site installs — its first guard checks
 * CmsPage::hasSiteIdColumn(), which is false when the multisite plugin
 * isn't installed.
