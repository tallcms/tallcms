- **Pages & Posts** - Static pages and blog posts with categories
- **Publishing Workflow** - Draft, Pending Review, Scheduled, and Published states
- **Revision History** - Track changes with diff comparison and rollback
- **Media Library** - Organize uploads with collections and metadata
- **Menu Builder** - Drag-and-drop navigation for multiple locations
- **Multilingual** - Full i18n support with locale-prefixed URLs
- **SEO Ready** - Meta tags, sitemaps, and structured data

Works as a standalone CMS or integrates into existing Filament applications.
