## Future Considerations

### Likely Plugins
- [ ] E-commerce (product catalog, cart, payments)
- [ ] Real estate (property listings, search filters, agent profiles)

### Exploring

## What TallCMS Is NOT

To stay focused, we're explicitly **not** building:

- **E-commerce platform** — Use dedicated solutions like Shopify, or integrate via plugins
- **Email marketing tool** — Integrate with Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.
- **Social network** — We're a CMS, not a community platform
- **Real-time collaboration** — Google Docs-style editing is out of scope
- **Mobile app** — Web-first with responsive admin

Some of these may be achievable via plugins from the marketplace.
