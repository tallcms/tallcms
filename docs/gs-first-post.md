## Posts vs Pages

| Feature | Posts | Pages |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Time-sensitive content (news, articles) | Evergreen content (About, Contact) |
| **Categories** | Yes | No |
| **Author** | Displayed prominently | Usually hidden |
| **Listing** | Shown in blog index | Shown in navigation |
| **URL format** | `/blog/post-slug` | `/page-slug` |

---

## Common Pitfalls

**"Post not showing in blog listing"**
Ensure the post is **Published** with a publish date in the past (not future).

**"Featured image not appearing"**
Upload the image in the **SEO** tab, not the content editor. Some themes require specific image sizes.

**"Category not showing"**
Categories only appear if they have at least one published post.
