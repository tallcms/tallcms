## Tips for Using Blocks

**Start with Hero**
Most pages benefit from a Hero block at the top to set the tone.

**Alternate block types**
Vary your blocks to create visual interest. Don't stack multiple Content blocks without variety.

**Use consistent styling**
Stick to 2-3 background colors throughout your site for a cohesive look.

**Preview often**
Use the Preview button to see how blocks look on the frontend.

---

## Common Pitfalls

**"Block looks different in preview"**
Admin preview shows structure but may not match exact theme styling. Always check the frontend.

**"Images are blurry"**
Upload high-resolution images. Most blocks work best with images at least 1200px wide.

**"Block not saving"**
Ensure all required fields are filled. Required fields are marked with an asterisk.
